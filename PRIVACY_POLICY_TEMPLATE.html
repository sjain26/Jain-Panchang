    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how the "तीर्थंकर वर्धमान Jain Panchang" ("we", "our", or "app") 
        handles information when you use our mobile application.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>We do not collect any personal information from users.</strong> This app operates 
        entirely offline after initial image loading, and we do not track, store, or transmit 
        any user data.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Image Loading</h2>
    <p>
        Calendar images are loaded from ImageKit.io CDN (Content Delivery Network) to provide 
        fast and reliable image delivery. This is a standard practice for mobile applications 
        that display images. No personal information is transmitted during this process.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        This app requires the following permission:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> Required to download calendar images from the CDN. 
        This permission is necessary for the app to function properly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We do not request or use any other permissions such as location, contacts, camera, 
        or storage access.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        The app may cache calendar images locally on your device to improve performance and 
        enable offline viewing. This data is stored only on your device and is not transmitted 
        to us or any third party.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        We use ImageKit.io as a CDN service to deliver calendar images. ImageKit.io may collect 
        standard web server logs (IP address, browser type) as part of their service. Please 
        refer to ImageKit.io's privacy policy for more information.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our app is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect any information 
        from children under 13 years of age.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this 
        page with an updated "Last updated" date.
